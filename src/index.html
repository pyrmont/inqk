        <p>Good ...evening?</p>

        <p>Whatever time it is, you're in the future. Which is kind of
        wild to think about. In February of 2018 when this is being
        written, I&rsquo;m in Tokyo, married with three kids. Which is
        also kind of wild to think about.</p>

        <p>So my name&rsquo;s Michael. I like programming and basketball
        and wish I were better at making time to read books and watch
        movies. I&rsquo;m originally from Australia but live in
        Japan.</p>

        <p>I occasionally write <a href="https://articles.inqk.net/">articles</a>,
        provide <a href="https://updates.inqk.net/">updates</a> and
        develop <a href="https://apps.inqk.net/">apps</a>. I&rsquo;m
        <a href="https://twitter.com/pyrmont/">@pyrmont</a> on Twitter.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s been very nice to meet you and I do hope we have a
        chance to do this again. Perhaps at your place next time.</p>

        <p>Best</p>

        <p>Michael.</p>
