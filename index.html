        <p>Good evening?</p>

        <p>Whatever time it is, you're in the future. Kind of wild to think about. In February of 2018 when this is being written, I'm in Tokyo, married with two kids.

        <p>I like programming and basketball and wish I were better at making time to read and watch movies.</p>

        <p>I occasionally write <a href="http://articles.inqk.net/">articles</a>, take <a href="http://photos.inqk.net/">photos</a> and provide <a href="https://updates.inqk.net/">updates</a>.

        <p>Michael.</p>

        <p class="ps">PS. I realise it’s a little gauche to put a period at the end of a signature but I’ve been doing it since I was 14 and would feel disingenuous if I stopped now.</p>
